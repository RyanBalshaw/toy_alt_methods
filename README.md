# toy_alt_methods
 A repo containing all notebooks that I have implemented. The repo name is outdated, as I started this repo for some simple methods, but I have since expanded it to contain a number of methods.
 
 This repo is still a work in progress, so beware, I cannot guarantee that each notebook is perfect. For example, the KDE notebook is definitely not complete. Hopefully one day it will be.
